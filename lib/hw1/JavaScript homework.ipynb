      "Because NodeJS allows I/O operations to be executed asynchronously. Asynchronous means that the execution   doesn’t run in the sequence it appears in the code -  doesn’t wait for the task to complete and can move on to the next task.The reason for I/O operations to be done asynchronously is that they are very slow and would block further execution of code  otherwise. All of the I/O methods in the Node.js standard library provide asynchronous versions, which are non-blocking.  Non-blocking I/O operations allow a single process to serve multiple requests at the same time. Instead of the process being  blocked and waiting for I/O operations to complete, the I/O operations are delegated to the system, so that the process can  execute the next piece of code. A good analogy for understanding what non-blocking means is the restaurant analogy. In a restaurant a waiter comes to a table, takes your order and gives it to the kitchen and he moves on to serve another table while the chef is cooking your meal - the waiter doesn't have to wait for your meal to be ready.\n"
